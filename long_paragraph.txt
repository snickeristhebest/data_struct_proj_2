THE Mississippi is well worth reading about. It is not a commonplace river, 
but on the contrary is in all ways remarkable. Considering the Missouri 
its main branch, it is the longest river in the worldåº¸our thousand 
three hundred miles. It seems safe to say that it is also 
the crookedest river in the world, since in one part of its 
journey it uses up one thousand three hundred miles to cover 
the same ground that the crow would fly over in six hundred 
and seventy-five. It discharges three times as much water 
as the St. Lawrence, twenty-five times as much as the Rhine, 
and three hundred and thirty-eight times as much as the Thames. 
No other river has so vast a drainage-basin: it draws its water 
supply from twenty-eight States and Territories; from Delaware, 
on the Atlantic seaboard, and from all the country between that 
and Idaho on the Pacific slope - a spread of forty-five degrees 
of longitude. The Mississippi receives and carries to the Gulf 
water from fifty-four subordinate rivers that are navigable by 
steamboats, and from some hundreds that are navigable by flats 
and keels. The area of its drainage-basin is as great as the 
combined areas of England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, France, 
Spain, Portugal, Germany, Austria, Italy, and Turkey; and almost 
all this wide region is fertile; the Mississippi valley, proper, 
is exceptionally so.
